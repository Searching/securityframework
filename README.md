# Security Framework
A .net claim based security framework(C#, Asp.net MVC).

A framework for asp.net mvc projects with group, claim and user manager plus row level security.

It can authenticate user by domain.   

ReadMe will be more informative asap!

For using this framework you have to change in code "domainname" to your domain also "user@test.com" to your desire username.
